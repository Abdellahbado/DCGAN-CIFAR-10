# DCGAN for CIFAR-10 Image Generation

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook contains code for implementing a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for generating CIFAR-10 images. The DCGAN architecture consists of a generator and a discriminator trained simultaneously to produce high-quality images.

## Dependencies
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow Datasets (tfds)

## Setup
1. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed.
2. Run the provided code in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Code Overview:

- Data Loading and Preprocessing:
        Loads the CIFAR-10 training dataset using TensorFlow Datasets.
        Normalizes pixel values between -1 and 1 for better model performance.

- Model Architecture:
        Generator:
            Takes a random noise vector of dimension 200 as input.
            Employs convolutional layers with LeakyReLU activations to progressively upscale the resolution and generate image features.
            Outputs a 32x32x3 RGB image using a final tanh activation.
        Discriminator:
            Takes a 32x32x3 RGB image as input.
            Employs convolutional layers with LeakyReLU activations to downsample the image and extract features.
            Outputs a single probability between 0 and 1, indicating whether the input is likely real (from CIFAR-10) or fake (generated).

- Training:
        Defines a custom DCGAN class to encapsulate the generator, discriminator, and training logic.
        Compiles the DCGAN model with separate optimizers for the generator and discriminator (Adam, learning rate 0.0002).
        Trains the model using an adversarial loss function. The discriminator aims to distinguish real from fake images, while the generator strives to fool the discriminator.
        Trains for 10 epochs.

- Evaluation and Visualization:
        Samples random noise vectors from a Gaussian distribution.
        Generates images using the trained generator on these noise vectors.
        Displays a grid of 12 generated images to visually assess the model's performance.

## Usage
1. Run the notebook cells sequentially.
2. Customize hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs as needed.
3. After training, explore the generated images using the provided visualization function.
